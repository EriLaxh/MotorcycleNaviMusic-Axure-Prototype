## Introduction

This **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project**, completed for **COMP 1649 Human Computer Interaction** at **SEGI College, Penang** (under the **University of Greenwich** program), presents an interactive UI/UX prototype for "Motorcycle Navi Music." The application is designed as a 2-in-1 mobile solution for motorcyclists, seamlessly integrating real-time navigation with music streaming. The project's core aim was to apply established HCI principles and user-centered design methodologies to overcome the unique challenges of mobile app interaction while riding, focusing on safety, clarity, and ease of use.

## Features

* **Intelligent Dual-Mode Operation:** The app dynamically switches between 'Ride Mode' (limited, hands-free interaction for safety) and 'Parked Mode' (full functionality) based on GPS speed detection and AI-based context recognition.
* **Seamless 2-in-1 Functionality:** Core design enables simultaneous, integrated use of turn-by-turn navigation and music playback, eliminating the need to switch between separate applications.
* **Rider-Centric UI/UX:** User interface is meticulously designed with an emphasis on large, clear touch targets, high-contrast visuals, and minimal distractions to ensure safer and more efficient interaction while on the go.
* **Intuitive Navigation Flows:** Demonstrates core navigation functionalities including route planning, real-time map display, and clear directional cues, optimized for quick comprehension.
* **Integrated Music Player:** Features essential music controls (play, pause, skip, volume) accessible directly within the navigation interface in Parked Mode, with voice/handlebar controls in Ride Mode.
* **Voice-Enabled AI Assistance:** Integrates AI-driven voice assistance and Bluetooth connectivity for hands-free operations, enhancing both safety and and convenience for riders.
* **Real-time Alerts & Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback through HUD indicators, AI audio cues, and Bluetooth vibration alerts for route updates, traffic, weather, and music changes.

## Key Methodologies & HCI Theories Applied

This project rigorously applied various HCI principles and theories to guide its design and ensure a user-centered approach:

* **Cognitive Load Theory:** Simplifies the display to show only essential information in Ride Mode (e.g., next turn, ETA) to minimize demands on a rider's limited cognitive resources.
* **Fitts’s Law:** Utilizes large, easily accessible buttons for core functions to allow quick, accurate interactions despite movement and limited interaction time.
* **Norman’s Seven Stages of Action:** Supports each stage of user interaction with clear feedback (HUD, audio cues, vibrations) to ensure riders remain aware of app status without diverting attention.
* **Affordance, Feedback, and Contextual AI:** Ensures controls are intuitive and recognizable, provides immediate confirmations, and adapts the app to the rider’s environment with real-time updates.
* **ISO 9241 Standard:** Adheres to ergonomic principles for usability and user experience, focusing on task suitability, self-descriptiveness, controllability, error tolerance, and learnability.
* **Design Principles (Don Norman's):**
    * **Visibility:** Only essential controls are shown in Ride Mode, with critical information projected via HUD.
    * **Feedback:** Immediate audio and visual feedback confirms user actions.
    * **Affordance:** Intuitive icons and tactile feedback make controls feel natural.
    * **Constraints:** Essential functions are active only in Ride Mode to prevent distractions.
    * **Customization & Personalization:** AI allows personalized music and route choices, with custom alerts.
* **Axure RP 11:** Utilized for high-fidelity interactive prototyping, translating complex user flows and HCI principles into a tangible and clickable experience.

## My Role

**Sole UI/UX Designer & Prototyper:** As part of a college HCI project, I independently conceived, designed, and developed this interactive prototype. My responsibilities included:

* **Problem Identification & User Analysis:** Defining the specific needs and pain points of motorcyclists interacting with mobile devices while riding.
* **Application of HCI Methodologies:** Consciously applying learned HCI theories and methodologies (e.g., Cognitive Load Theory, Fitts's Law, Norman's Seven Stages of Action, ISO 9241) to inform design decisions for safety, usability, and user experience.
* **User Experience (UX) Design:** Mapping out simultaneous navigation and music playback user flows, defining optimal information architecture, and ensuring intuitive interaction sequences given environmental constraints.
* **User Interface (UI) Design:** Crafting the visual layout, interactive elements, typography, and color schemes, with a critical focus on readability, large touch targets, and minimal visual clutter suitable for a riding environment.
* **Interactive Prototyping:** Building the high-fidelity, clickable prototype in Axure RP 11 to demonstrate the seamless integration and interactive experience, serving as a key deliverable for the project.

## Proposed Future Enhancements 

* **Dynamic Stop Additions:** Implement a `+` icon in the Edit Stops interface for easy addition of new stops at specific route points, streamlining planning and offering greater flexibility.
* **Day Mode and Night Mode:** Introduce a mode-switching feature to adjust the interface’s color scheme for different lighting conditions, improving visibility and usability in varying environments.
* **Location Descriptions and Reviews:** Expand the location details panel to include brief descriptions, user reviews, and ratings for destinations, providing valuable insights for route planning.
* **Personalization Options:** Allow users to customize the interface with adjustable color schemes, font sizes, and icon styles to cater to individual needs and improve satisfaction.
