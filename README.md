## Introduction

This **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) project**, completed for **COMP 1649 Human Computer Interaction** at **SEGI College, Penang** (under the **University of Greenwich** program), presents an interactive UI/UX prototype for "Motorcycle Navi Music." The application is designed as a 2-in-1 mobile solution for motorcyclists, seamlessly integrating real-time navigation with music streaming. The project's core aim was to apply established HCI principles and user-centered design methodologies to overcome the unique challenges of mobile app interaction while riding, focusing on safety, clarity, and ease of use.

## Features

* **Intelligent Dual-Mode Operation:** The app dynamically switches between 'Ride Mode' (limited, hands-free interaction for safety) and 'Parked Mode' (full functionality) based on GPS speed detection and AI-based context recognition.
* **Seamless 2-in-1 Functionality:** Core design enables simultaneous, integrated use of turn-by-turn navigation and music playback, eliminating the need to switch between separate applications.
* **Rider-Centric UI/UX:** User interface is meticulously designed with an emphasis on large, clear touch targets, high-contrast visuals, and minimal distractions to ensure safer and more efficient interaction while on the go.
* **Intuitive Navigation Flows:** Demonstrates core navigation functionalities including route planning, real-time map display, and clear directional cues, optimized for quick comprehension.
* **Integrated Music Player:** Features essential music controls (play, pause, skip, volume) accessible directly within the navigation interface in Parked Mode, with voice/handlebar controls in Ride Mode.
* **Voice-Enabled AI Assistance:** Integrates AI-driven voice assistance and Bluetooth connectivity for hands-free operations, enhancing both safety and and convenience for riders.
* **Real-time Alerts & Feedback:** Provides immediate feedback through HUD indicators, AI audio cues, and Bluetooth vibration alerts for route updates, traffic, weather, and music changes.

## Key Methodologies & HCI Theories Applied

This project rigorously applied various HCI principles and theories to guide its design and ensure a user-centered approach:

* **Cognitive Load Theory:** Simplifies the display to show only essential information in Ride Mode (e.g., next turn, ETA) to minimize demands on a rider's limited cognitive resources.
* **Fitts’s Law:** Utilizes large, easily accessible buttons for core functions to allow quick, accurate interactions despite movement and limited interaction time.
* **Norman’s Seven Stages of Action:** Supports each stage of user interaction with clear feedback (HUD, audio cues, vibrations) to ensure riders remain aware of app status without diverting attention.
* **Affordance, Feedback, and Contextual AI:** Ensures controls are intuitive and recognizable, provides immediate confirmations, and adapts the app to the rider’s environment with real-time updates.
* **ISO 9241 Standard:** Adheres to ergonomic principles for usability and user experience, focusing on task suitability, self-descriptiveness, controllability, error tolerance, and learnability.
* **Design Principles (Don Norman's):**
    * **Visibility:** Only essential controls are shown in Ride Mode, with critical information projected via HUD.
    * **Feedback:** Immediate audio and visual feedback confirms user actions.
    * **Affordance:** Intuitive icons and tactile feedback make controls feel natural.
    * **Constraints:** Essential functions are active only in Ride Mode to prevent distractions.
    * **Customization & Personalization:** AI allows personalized music and route choices, with custom alerts.
* **Axure RP 11:** Utilized for high-fidelity interactive prototyping, translating complex user flows and HCI principles into a tangible and clickable experience.

## My Role

**Sole UI/UX Designer & Prototyper:** As part of a college HCI project, I independently conceived, designed, and developed this interactive prototype. My responsibilities included:

* **Problem Identification & User Analysis:** Defining the specific needs and pain points of motorcyclists interacting with mobile devices while riding.
* **Application of HCI Methodologies:** Consciously applying learned HCI theories and methodologies (e.g., Cognitive Load Theory, Fitts's Law, Norman's Seven Stages of Action, ISO 9241) to inform design decisions for safety, usability, and user experience.
* **User Experience (UX) Design:** Mapping out simultaneous navigation and music playback user flows, defining optimal information architecture, and ensuring intuitive interaction sequences given environmental constraints.
* **User Interface (UI) Design:** Crafting the visual layout, interactive elements, typography, and color schemes, with a critical focus on readability, large touch targets, and minimal visual clutter suitable for a riding environment.
* **Interactive Prototyping:** Building the high-fidelity, clickable prototype in Axure RP 11 to demonstrate the seamless integration and interactive experience, serving as a key deliverable for the project.

## Research Study / Usability Evaluation (Proposed)

As part of this HCI project, a research study was proposed to evaluate the usability and visual clarity of the mid-fidelity prototype for motorbike riders. The objective was to assess how effectively the design communicates its functionality and supports navigation and music management while aligning with safety principles.

The proposed methodology involved:
* **Participants:** 10–15 motorbike riders aged 18–50 years with diverse familiarity with navigation and music applications.
* **Procedure:** Participants would review static prototype screens based on hypothetical task scenarios, followed by pre- and post-study questionnaires and semi-structured interviews to gather feedback on usability and clarity.
* **Data Analysis:** Quantitative analysis of questionnaire responses (ease of use, visual clarity, perceived safety) and qualitative analysis of participant feedback to identify strengths, challenges, and suggestions.

The expected outcomes aimed to validate the prototype's visual intuitiveness, assess information clarity for quick decision-making, identify design strengths and gaps, and evaluate perceived safety, particularly in high-stakes navigation scenarios.
